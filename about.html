        <h4>Photography</h4>
        <p>
            My firat hobby I ever developed since childhood is photography. When 
            I got camera in hand, I was so much enthusiastics to take picture with beautiful background. Now I take lots of picture using iphone. The current 
            iphone camera is constantly evolving with iphone technology. 
            I also love editing my pictures using various different types of filters. I also enjoy taking video's. I bring any picture on Adobe photoshop to recreate it.
            Professionally I have taken course on photoshop to recreate big collard posters using various photosnaps.

            Jogging keeps me fit days when I donot use bike. Jogging going up in parks make me very happy. I enjoy watch green surrounding, plants while jogging. Jogging makes my day lovely.
